# Examples in React

We've included a few examples for you in [React](https://reactjs.org/). Use this project to immediately start making calls, or as a jumping off point for your own Telnyx WebRTC project. Examples are provided as [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) components.

## Getting started

You'll need Telnyx account to get started. [Sign up for free](https://telnyx.com/sign-up) and then follow our [quick start guide](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/v2/webrtc/quickstart) to retrieve your authentication credentials.

## Running the examples

Set up and install the demo app:

```
npm run setup
npm install
```

To start the Storybook app:

```
npm run storybook
```

Your preferred browser should automatically open up to <http://localhost:6006>.

Enter in your Telnyx WebRTC authentication credentials in the "Authentication" panel. Use the "Controls" panel to configure your destination number, caller number and other per-component options.
